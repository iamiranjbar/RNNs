# RNNs

This is the sixth project of Neural Network course at the University of Tehran.

We learn about Recurrent Neural Networks(RNNs).

We developed Recurrent Network with GRU, LSTM and RNN Cells using Pytorch. We use these networks to predict bitcoin price as a time-series data and sentiment analysis in sentences.
